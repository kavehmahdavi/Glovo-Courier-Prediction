# Glovo_Courier_Analysis

## Challenge to solve

Glovo asked to help them improve their internal back office tool that deals with the management of 
their end-customer facing delivery service.  

To put it simple, for each day there is a certain number of delivery slots to fill with couriers, just enough to 
cover the forecasted demand of deliveries, and not too many in order to avoid having couriers without work to do by 
predicting their performance and efficiency.

Major goals were:
• Automate courier management process
• Increase operations efficiency
• Increase utilisation rate of couriers
• Reduce courier churn
